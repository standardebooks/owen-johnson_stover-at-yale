			<p>When Stover returned to his rooms, it was long after supper.</p>
			<p>“Where the deuce have you been?” said Hungerford, looking up from his books.</p>
			<p>“Went for a drive, got home late,” said Stover shortly. He filled the companionable pipe, and sank into the low armchair, which Regan had broken for comfort. Something in his abrupt procedure caused Bob Story to look over at Regan with an inquiring raise of his eyebrows.</p>
			<p>“Got this psychology yet?” said Hungerford, to try him out.</p>
			<p>“No,” said Stover.</p>
			<p>“Going to get it?”</p>
			<p>“No.”</p>
			<p>“The thinghood of a thing is its indefinable somewhatness,” said Hungerford, with another slashing attack on the common enemy, to divert Stover’s attention. “What in the name of peanuts does that stuff mean?”</p>
			<p>Dink, refusing to be drawn into conversation, sat enveloped in smoke clouds, his eyes on the clock.</p>
			<p>“Hello, I forgot,” said Story presently. “I say, Dink, Troutman and Schley were around here hallooing for you.”</p>
			<p>“They were, eh?”</p>
			<p>“About an hour ago. Wanted to see you particularly. Said they’d be around again.”</p>
			<p>“I see.”</p>
			<p>At this moment from below came a bellow:</p>
			<p>“Oh, Dink Stover⁠—hello above there!”</p>
			<p>“That’s Troutman now,” said Joe Hungerford.</p>
			<p>Stover went to the window, flinging it up.</p>
			<p>“Well, who’s there?”</p>
			<p>“Troutman and Chris Schley. I say, Dink, we’ve got to see you. Come on down.”</p>
			<p>“Thanks, I haven’t the slightest desire to see you now or at any other time,” said Stover, who closed the window and resumed his seat, eyeing the clock.</p>
			<p>His three friends exchanged troubled glances, and Regan began to whistle to himself, but no questions were asked. At nine o’clock Stover rose and took his hat.</p>
			<p>“I’m going out. I may be back late,” he said, and went down the stairs.</p>
			<p>“What the devil?” said Hungerford, closing his book.</p>
			<p>“He’s in some scrape,” said Regan ruthfully.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Lord, and just at this time, too,” said Story.</p>
			<p>Stover went rapidly towards the hospital. The girl had been operated on immediately, and the situation was of the utmost seriousness. He had been told to come back at nine. When he arrived he found Muriel Stacey already in the waiting-room, her eyes heavy with frightened weeping. He looked at her curiously. All suggestion of the provoking impertinence and the surface allurement was gone. Under his eyes was nothing but an ignorant boor, stupid and hysterical before the awful fact of death.</p>
			<p>“What’s the news?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stover, I don’t know. I can’t get anything out of them,” the woman said wildly. “Oh, do you think she’s going to die?”</p>
			<p>“Of course not,” he said gruffly. “See here, where’s her family?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t they live here?”</p>
			<p>“They’re in Ohio somewhere, I think. I don’t know. Ask the doctor, won’t you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stover? He’ll tell you something.”</p>
			<p>He left her, and, making inquiries, was met by a young intern, immaculate and alert, who was quite communicative to Dink Stover of the Yale eleven.</p>
			<p>“She’s had a bad case of it; appendix had already burst. You got her here just in time.”</p>
			<p>“What’s the outlook?”</p>
			<p>“Can’t tell. She came out of the anaesthetic all right.” He went into a technical discussion of the dangers of blood poisoning, concluding: “Still, I should say her chances were good. It depends a good deal on the resistance. However, I think your friend’s family ought to be notified.”</p>
			<p>Stover did not notice the “your friend,” nor the look which the doctor gave him.</p>
			<p>“She’s here alone as far as I can find out,” he said. “Poor little devil. I’ll call round about midnight.”</p>
			<p>“No need,” said the doctor briskly, “nothing’ll develop before tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>Stover sent the waiting girl home somewhat tranquilized, and, finding a florist’s shop open, left an order to be sent in to the patient the first thing in the morning. Then, thoroughly exhausted by his sudden contact with all the nervous fates of the hospital, he walked home and heavily to bed.</p>
			<p>The next morning as he went to his eating-joint with Regan and Hungerford, the newsboy, who had his papers ready, gave them to him with a hesitating look. All at once Joe Hungerford swore mightily.</p>
			<p>“Now what’s wrong, Joe?” said Regan in surprise.</p>
			<p>“Nothing,” said Hungerford hastily, but almost immediately he stopped, and said in a jerky, worried way: “Say, here’s the devil to pay, Dink. I suppose you ought to know about it. Damn the papers.”</p>
			<p>With his finger he indicated a space on the front page of the New York newspaper he was reading. Stover took it, reading it seriously. It was only a paragraph, but it rose from the page as though it were stamped in scarlet.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Dink Stover’s Lark<br/>
				Ends Seriously.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Below followed in suggestive detail an account of the drive with friends “not exactly in recognized New Haven society,” and the sudden seizure of Miss Fanny Le Roy, with an account of his drive back to the hospital.</p>
			<p>“That’s pretty bad,” he said, frowning. “What do the others say?”</p>
			<p>One paper had it that his presence of mind and prompt action had saved the girl’s life. The third one hinted that the party had been rather gay, and said in a short sentence:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“It is said other students were with young Stover, who prefer not to incur any unnecessary notoriety.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“It looks ugly,” said Stover grimly.</p>
			<p>“Who was with you?” said Hungerford anxiously.</p>
			<p>“I prefer not to tell.”</p>
			<p>“Troutman and Schley, of course,” said Regan suddenly, and, starting out of his usual imperturbability, he began to revile them.</p>
			<p>“But, Dink, old man,” said Hungerford, drawing his arm through his, “how the deuce did you ever get into it?”</p>
			<p>“Well, Joe, what’s the use of explanations?” said Stover gloomily. “Everyone’ll believe what they want to. It’s a thoroughly nasty mess. It’s my luck, that’s all.”</p>
			<p>“Is that all you can say?” said Hungerford anxiously.</p>
			<p>“All just now. I don’t feel particularly affable, Joe.”</p>
			<p>The walk from his eating-joint to the chapel was perhaps the most difficult thing he had ever done. Everyone was reading the news, commenting on it, as he passed along, red, proud, and angry. He felt the fire of amazed glances, the lower classmen looking up at the big man of the junior class in disgrace, his own friends puzzled and uncomprehending.</p>
			<p>At the fences there was an excited buzz, which dropped perceptibly as he passed. Regan was at one side, Hungerford loyally on the other. At the junior fence Bob Story, who had just got the report, came out hurriedly to him.</p>
			<p>“I say, Dink, it⁠—it isn’t true?” he said. “Something’s wrong⁠—must be!”</p>
			<p>“Not very far wrong,” said Stover. He saw the incredulity in Bob’s face, and it hurt him more than all the rest.</p>
			<p>“Even Bob thinks I’m that sort, that I’ve been doing things on the sly I wouldn’t stand for in public. And if he thinks it, what’ll others think?”</p>
			<p>“Shut up, Bob,” he heard Regan say. “It may look a nasty mess, and Dink may not tell the real story, but one thing I know, he didn’t scuttle off like a scut, but faced the music, and that’s all I want to know.”</p>
			<p>Stover laughed, a short, nervous, utterly illogical laugh, defiant and stubborn. He would never tell what had happened⁠—let those who wanted to misjudge him.</p>
			<p>Several men in his class⁠—he remembered them ever after⁠—came up and patted him on the back, one or two avoided him. Then he had to go by the senior fence into chapel with every eye upon him, watching how he bore the scandal. He knew he was red and uncomfortable, that on his face was something like a sneer. He knew that what everyone was saying under his voice was that it was hard luck, damned hard luck, that it was a rotten scandal, and that Stover’s chances for Skull and Bones were knocked higher than a kite.</p>
			<p>Then something happened that almost upset him. In the press about the chapel doors he suddenly saw Le Baron’s tall figure across the scrambling mass. Their glances met and with a little solemnity Le Baron raised his hat. He understood; they might be enemies to the end of their days, but the hat had been raised as the tribute of a man to a man. Once in his seat he looked about with a little scorn⁠—Troutman and Schley were not there.</p>
			<p>After first recitation he went directly to the hospital, stubbornly resolved to give no explanations, stubbornly resolved in his own knowledge of his right to affront public opinion in any way he chose. The news he received was reassuring, the girl was out of danger. Muriel Stacey not yet arrived, for which he was physically thankful.</p>
			<p>He returned to his rooms, traversing the difficult campus with erect head.</p>
			<p>“Now, boy, see here,” said Hungerford, when he had climbed the stairs, “I want this out with you. What did happen, and who ran away?”</p>
			<p>“You’ve got the story in the papers, haven’t you?” said Stover wearily. “The New Haven ones have in a couple of columns and my photograph.”</p>
			<p>“Is that all, Dink, you’re going to tell me?”</p>
			<p>“Yes.”</p>
			<p>“Is that all you’re going to let Jean Story know?” said Hungerford boldly.</p>
			<p>Stover winced.</p>
			<p>“Damn you, Joe!”</p>
			<p>“Is it?”</p>
			<p>“She’ll have to believe what she wants to about me,” said Stover slowly. “It’s a test.”</p>
			<p>“No, it isn’t a test or a fair test,” said Hungerford hotly. “I know everything’s all right, boy, but I want to stop anything that might be said. You’re hurt now because you know you’re misjudged.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I am hurt.”</p>
			<p>“Sure; a rotten bit of luck has put you in a false position. That’s the whole matter.”</p>
			<p>“Joe, I won’t tell you,” said Stover shortly. “I am mad clear through and through. I’m going to shut up on the whole business. If my friends misjudge me⁠—so much the worse for them. If someone else⁠—” He stopped, flung his hat on the couch, and sat down at the desk. “What’s the lesson?”</p>
			<p>But at this moment Regan and Story came in, bolting the door.</p>
			<p>“Well, we’ve got the truth,” said Story. He came over and laid his hand on Dink’s shoulder.</p>
			<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
			<p>“Tom and I have had it out with Schley and Troutman. They’ve told the whole thing, the miserable little curs.” His voice shook. “You’re all right, Dink; you always were, but it’s a shame⁠—a damn shame!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, well, they lost their nerve,” said Stover heavily.</p>
			<p>“Why the devil didn’t you tell us last night?”</p>
			<p>“What was the use?”</p>
			<p>“We could have stopped its getting into the papers, or had it right.”</p>
			<p>“Well⁠—it all comes down to a question of luck sometimes,” said Stover. “I was just as responsible as they were⁠—it was only fooling, but there’s the chance.”</p>
			<p>“Dink, I’ve done one thing you may not like.”</p>
			<p>“What’s that?”</p>
			<p>“I’ve written the whole story to your folks at home⁠—sent it off.”</p>
			<p>“No⁠—I don’t mind⁠—I⁠—that was rather white of you, Bob⁠—thank you,” said Stover. He drew a long breath, went to the window and controlled himself. “What are Troutman and Schley going to do?”</p>
			<p>“They’re all broken up,” said Story.</p>
			<p>“Don’t wonder.”</p>
			<p>“They won’t face it out very long,” said Regan, without pity.</p>
			<p>“Well, it was a pretty hard test,” said Stover, coming back⁠—and by that alone they knew what it had meant to him.</p>
			<p>Despite the giving out of the true story, the atmosphere of scandal still clung to the adventure. His friends rallied stanchly to him, but from many quarters Stover felt the attitude of criticism, and that the thing had been too public not to affect the judgment of the senior societies, already none too well disposed toward him.</p>
			<p>Stover was sensitively proud, and the thought of how the story had traveled with all its implications wounded him keenly. He had done nothing wrong, nothing for which he had to blush. He had simply acted as a human being, as any decent gentleman would have acted, and yet by a malignant turn of fate he was blackguarded to the outer world, and had given his enemies in college a chance to imply that he had two attitudes⁠—in public and in secret.</p>
			<p>The next morning came a note to him from Jean Story, the first he had ever had from her⁠—just a few lines.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">“My Dear Friend:</p>
				<p>“You are coming in soon to see me, aren’t you? I shall be very much <em>honored</em>.</p>
				<footer role="presentation">
					<p epub:type="z3998:valediction">“Most cordially,</p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:sender z3998:signature">“Jean Story.”</p>

			</blockquote>
			<p>The note brought a great lump to his throat. He understood what she wished him to understand, her loyalty and her pride in his courage. He read it over and over, and placed it in his pocketbook to carry always⁠—but he did not go at once to see her. He did not want sympathy; he shunned the very thought. Before, in his revolt, he had come against a college tradition, now he was face to face with a social prejudice, and it brought an indignant bitterness.</p>
			<p>He called every day at the hospital; out of sheer bravado at first, furious at the public opinion that would have him go his way and ignore a human being alone and suffering, even when his motives were pure.</p>
			<p>At the end of a week he was told that the girl wanted to see him. He found her in a cot among a row of other cots. She was not white and drawn as he had expected, but with a certain flush of color in her face, and lazy eyes that eagerly waited his coming. When he had approached, surprised and a little troubled at her prettiness, she looked at him steadily a long moment until he felt almost embarrassed. Then suddenly she took his hand and carried it to her lips, and her eyes overflowed with tears, as an invalid’s do with the strength of any emotion.</p>
			<p>The nurse motioned him away, and he went, troubled at what his boyish eyes had seen, and the touch of her lips on his hand.</p>
			<p>“By George, she can’t be very bad,” he thought. “Poor little girl; she’s probably never had half a chance. What the devil will become of her?”</p>
			<p>He knew nothing of her life⁠—he did not want to know.</p>
			<p>When she left the hospital at last he continued to see her, always saying to himself that there was no harm in it, concealing from himself the pleasure it gave him to know himself adored.</p>
			<p>She would never tell him where she lived, always giving him a rendezvous on a certain corner, from which they would take a walk for an hour or so. Guessing his desires, she began to change her method of dress, leaving aside the artifices, taking to simple and sober dress, which brought a curious, girlish, counterfeit charm.</p>
			<p>“I am doing her good,” he said to himself. “It means something to her to meet someone who treats her with respect⁠—like a human being⁠—poor little girl.”</p>
			<p>He did not realize how often he met her, leaving his troubled roommates with a curt excuse, nor how rapidly he consumed the distance to their meeting place. He had talked to her at first seriously of serious things, then gradually, laughing in a boyish way, half tempted, he began to pay her compliments. At first she laughed with a little pleasure, but, as the new attitude continued, he felt her eyes on his face constantly in anxious, wistful scrutiny.</p>
			<p>One night she did not keep her appointment. He waited troubled, then furious. He left after an hour’s lingering, irritable and aroused.</p>
			<p>The next night as he approached impatiently, half afraid, she was already at the lamppost.</p>
			<p>“I waited an hour,” he said directly.</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry; I couldn’t come,” she answered troubled, but without volunteering an explanation.</p>
			<p>“Why?” he said with a new irritation.</p>
			<p>“I couldn’t,” she said, shaking her head.</p>
			<p>He felt all at once a new impulse in him⁠—to wound her in some way and make her suffer a little for the disappointment he had had to undergo the night before.</p>
			<p>“You did it on purpose,” he said abruptly.</p>
			<p>“No, no,” she said frowning.</p>
			<p>“You did.” Then suddenly he added: “That’s why you stayed away⁠—to make me jealous.”</p>
			<p>“Never.”</p>
			<p>“Why, then?”</p>
			<p>“I can’t tell you,” she said.</p>
			<p>They walked along in silence. Her resistance in withholding the information suddenly made her desirable. He wondered what he might do with her. As they walked still in silence, he put out his hand, and his fingers closed over hers. She did not draw them away. He gave a deep breath and said:</p>
			<p>“I would like⁠—”</p>
			<p>“What?” she said, looking up as his pressure made her face him.</p>
			<p>He put out his arms and took her in them, and stood a long moment, looking at her lips.</p>
			<p>“Forgive me⁠—I⁠—” he said, stepping back suddenly. “I⁠—I didn’t mean to offend you.”</p>
			<p>“No⁠—you couldn’t do that⁠—never,” she said quietly.</p>
			<p>“You⁠—you’re so pretty tonight⁠—I couldn’t help it,” he said. To himself he vowed he would never let himself be tempted again⁠—not that night.</p>
			<p>“I’m going to take you to your home,” he said, when after small conversation they returned.</p>
			<p>“Sure.”</p>
			<p>He was surprised and delighted at this, but almost immediately to be generous he said:</p>
			<p>“No, no, I won’t.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t care.”</p>
			<p>They had reached their corner.</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“Yes.”</p>
			<p>“At eight.”</p>
			<p>“Yes.”</p>
			<p>He resisted a great temptation, and offered his hand. She took it suddenly in both of hers and brought it to her lips as she had done in the hospital.</p>
			<p>“You’ve been white, awful white to me,” she said, and flitted away into the engulfing night.</p>
			<p>When he left her, her words came back to him, and brought an unrest. He had almost yielded to what he had vowed never to do, he, who only wanted her to feel his respect. Yet the next day seemed endless. He regretted that he had not gone to where she lived, for then he could have found her in the afternoon.</p>
			<p>A shower passed during the day, leaving the streets moist and luminous with long lances of light and star points on the wet stones. He went breathlessly as he had never gone before, a little troubled, always reasoning with his conscience.</p>
			<p>“It was only a crazy spell,” he said to himself. “I don’t know what got into me. I’ll be careful, now.”</p>
			<p>When he reached the lamppost another figure was there, Muriel Stacey, painted and overdressed, and in her hand was a white letter, that he saw halfway up the block. He stopped short, frowning.</p>
			<p>“Where’s Fanny?”</p>
			<p>“Here’s a note she sent you,” said the girl; “she’s gone.”</p>
			<p>“Gone?”</p>
			<p>“This morning.”</p>
			<p>He looked at the envelope; his name was written there in a childish, struggling hand.</p>
			<p>“All right; thank you,” he said suffocating. He left hurriedly, physically uncomfortable in the presence of Muriel Stacey, her friend. At the first lamppost he stopped, broke the envelope, and read the awkward, painfully written script.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>“I’m going away, it’s best for you and me I know it. Guess I would care too much and I’m not good enough for you. Don’t you be angry with me. Good luck. God bless you.</p>

			</blockquote>
			<p>He slipped it hurriedly in his pocket, and set off at a wild pace. And suddenly his conscience, his accusing conscience, rose up. He saw where he had been going. It brought him a solemn moment. Then he remembered the girl. He took the letter from his pocket and held it clutched like a hand in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Good God,” he said, “I wonder what’ll become of her?”</p>
			<p>He had found so much good that the tragedy revolted him. So he went through the busy streets with their flare and ceaseless motion, in the wet of the night, watching with solemn, melancholy eyes, other women pass with sidelong glances. All the horror and the hopelessness of a life he could not better thronged over him, and he stood a long while looking down the great bleak ways, through the gates that it is better not to pry ajar.</p>
			<p>Then in a revulsion of feeling, terrified at what he divined, he left and went, almost in an instinct for protection, hurriedly to the Story home, white and peaceful under the elms. He did not go in, but he stood a little while opposite, looking in through the warm windows at the serenity and the security that seemed to permeate the place.</p>
			<p>When he returned to his rooms, Joe and Regan were there. He sat down directly and told them the whole story, showing them her letter.</p>
			<p>“She went away⁠—for my sake,” he said. “I know it. Poor little devil. It’s a letter I’ll always keep.” Solemnly, looking at the letter, he resolved to put this with the one, the first from Jean Story, and reverently he felt that the two had the right to be joined.</p>
			<p>“What’s terrible about it,” he said, talking out his soul, “is that there’s so much good in them. And yet what can you do? They’re human, they respond, you can’t help pitying them⁠—wanting to be decent, to help⁠—and you can’t. It’s terrible to think that there are certain doors in life you open and close, that you must turn your back on human lives sometimes, that things can’t be changed. Lord, but it’s a terrible thing to realize.”</p>
			<p>He stopped, and he heard Regan’s voice, moved as he had never heard it, say:</p>
			<p>“That’s my story⁠—only <em>I</em> married.”</p>
			<p>Suddenly, as though realizing for the first time what he had said, he burst out: “Good God, I never meant to tell. See here, you men, that’s sacred⁠—you understand.”</p>
			<p>And Dink and Joe, looking on his face, realized all at once why a certain gentler side of life was shut out to him, and why he had never gone to the Storys’.</p>
